# Integrative Data Analysis Tool

This tool is designed for bioinformatics professionals to perform integrative data analysis on gene expression, genotype, and epigenetic data. The tool includes functions for data pre-processing, PCA analysis, random forest analysis, t-test analysis, and hierarchical clustering analysis. The tool also includes the option for performing functional enrichment analysis using gene ontology or pathway analysis software.

## Prerequisites

This tool requires the following libraries to be installed:

-   argparse
-   pandas
-   numpy
-   sklearn
-   scipy
-   seaborn
-   matplotlib

## Usage

    python integrative-data-analysis.py gene_expression_file genotype_file epigenetic_file [--group1 GROUP1] [--group2 GROUP2]

-   `gene_expression_file`: Path to the gene expression data file.
-   `genotype_file`: Path to the genotype data file.
-   `epigenetic_file`: Path to the epigenetic data file.
-   `--group1`: Name of the first sample group for t-test analysis (optional).
-   `--group2`: Name of the second sample group for t-test analysis (optional).

## Data pre-processing

The following data pre-processing functions are applied to the gene expression data:

-   Normalization: The data is normalized using the mean and standard deviation of each gene.
-   Filtering: Genes with low expression or low variance are filtered out.
-   Imputation: Missing values are imputed using mean imputation.

## Analysis

The following analyses are performed on the pre-processed gene expression data:

-   PCA analysis: Principal component analysis is performed and the results are displayed.
-   Random forest analysis: Random forest classification is performed and the results are displayed.
-   T-test analysis: Two-sample t-test is performed between two groups of samples (if `--group1` and `--group2` are specified) and the p-value is displayed.
-   Hierarchical clustering analysis: Hierarchical clustering is performed and the results are displayed as a dendrogram.

## Output

The following results are output:

-   PCA results: The first few rows of the PCA transformed data.
-   Explained variance: The explained variance for each principal component.
-   Random forest results: The classification report for the random forest analysis.
-   T-test p-value: The p-value for the t-test analysis (if `--group1` and `--group2` are specified).
